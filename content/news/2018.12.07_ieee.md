Together with the other delegates from the first [TIM workshop](/news/2018.05.06_first-trust-workshop/) earlier in the year, I've published a paper in the [IEEE Technology and Society Magazine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=44) entitled "[Trusting Intelligent Machines: Deepening Trust Within Socio-Technical Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8558724)".
