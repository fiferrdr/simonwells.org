I presented a talk to the delegates of the twentieth Computational Models of Natural Argument Workshop on the subject of "[Datastores for Argumentation Data](/talks/#freshers2020)" in which he talked about SADFace & the ArgDB as a way to store and manipulate argumentative datasets. MonkeyPuzzle was described as a method for eliciting argument data through manual analysis to form an argument analysis pipeline as part of a case study.

The following links will take you directly to the project pages for each of the three software tools that I talked about today:

* [SADFace](http://arg.napier.ac.uk/projects/sadface/)
* [ArgDB](http://arg.napier.ac.uk/projects/argdb/)
* [MonkeyPuzzle](http://arg.napier.ac.uk/projects/monkeypuzzle/)
