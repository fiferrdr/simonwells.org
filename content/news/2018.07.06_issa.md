Together with my colleague, Al Baker, I presented a paper at the 9th Conference of the [International Society for the Study of Argumentation](http://cf.hum.uva.nl/issa/) hosted by the University of Amsterdam. Our [paper](/publications#wells_2018_issa) is on the theme of lying machines and investigates the question of when a machine should be able to lie.
