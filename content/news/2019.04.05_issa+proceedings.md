Together with my colleague, Al Baker, I published a paper in the proceedings of the 9th Conference of the [International Society for the Study of Argumentation](http://cf.hum.uva.nl/issa/) hosted by the University of Amsterdam. Our [paper](/publications#wells_2018_issa) is on the theme of deception and intelligent machines. More specifically, we investigated som of the question of when a machine should lie or otherwise decieve during interaction with people.
