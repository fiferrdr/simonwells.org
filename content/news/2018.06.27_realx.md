I presented a paper at the SICSA AI Theme [workshop on Reasoning, Learning, & Explainability (ReaLX)](https://sites.google.com/view/realx18/programme) hosted by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. My paper was on the subject of argumentative dialogue protocols and argumentation schemes as a fundamental and humange framework for achieving composable and explainable AI systems.
