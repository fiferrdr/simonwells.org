At the recent Third European Conference on Argumentation (ECA) I presented a paper entitled "A Paroxysm of Dissent: Partisan Political Advertising During the Brexit Campaign". The paper is about the online advertisements used within the Brexit campaign prior to the 2016 referendum. The core dataset that I worked with was that submitted in evidence to the House of Commons Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee with a remit that focussed on "disinformation & fake news".
