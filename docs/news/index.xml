Our broad goal is to explore some of the issues and probelms associated with increasing delegation of decision making to artificially intelligent machines where the outcomes affect the well being of humans.</description>

      <description>A new look but the same content. Moved from a hand-generated static site that had served me well for nearly ten years to a Hugo generated static site. The design is modern and clean and should be a little easier to keep up to date.</description>
